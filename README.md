# demo
This little project is an example of how the Java Spring Framework can be used to create a RESTful application 
(i.e an application that can communicate and manupulate a database and is used to create APIs) 
In order to use this just simply clone this repository onto your machine, 
Using an IDE of your choice (I would recommend IntelliJ) Open the folder of the repository. 
Make sure that you have the following on your system: 
- Java JDK (V 11) 
- docker (latest version)
